Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Nuxt Application

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured @vercel/analytics package for the Nuxt.js application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics@1.6.1` using npm
- Added dependency to package.json

### 2. Modified Files

#### Frontend/app/app.vue
- Added import statement for Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/nuxt' in the <script setup> section
- Added `<Analytics />` component to the template, placed within <NuxtLayout> alongside <NuxtPage />
- Preserved all existing code structure including page transitions and zoom prevention logic

#### Frontend/package.json
- Added "@vercel/analytics": "^1.6.1" to dependencies

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was strategically placed:
- Inside the `<NuxtLayout>` component to ensure it's rendered across all pages
- After the `<ClientOnly>` wrapper containing the page transitions
- This ensures analytics tracking is active throughout the application

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully using `npm run build`
✅ No TypeScript errors introduced
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Analytics package properly installed and configured

## Notes

- The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for Nuxt integration
- The Analytics component is automatically configured when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is needed in nuxt.config.ts for basic analytics functionality
- The existing app structure (page transitions, zoom prevention, etc.) remains unchanged
